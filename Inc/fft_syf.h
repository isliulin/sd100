//频谱泄漏最直接的影响是造成谐波分析不准确 ,进而造成以谐波分析为基础的电参量测量不准确。 
//1  增加数据采样点数 ,可减少泄漏 ,其实质是减小矩形窗主瓣的宽度。 
//2  提高信号的采样频率也可减少泄漏。 
//上述两种方法 ,与增加的数据处理量相比 ,对泄漏的改善是极其有限的。
//3  文献提出了窗函数和内插技术。选择窗函数的基本原则是要求其主瓣窄 ,边瓣小 ,尽可能使这两个要求得到兼顾 ,通常选择汉宁窗。
//从时域看 ,加汉宁窗实际上就是使周期采样信号的起始点和终止点的相位为 0,克服由于频率波动造成的采样信号相位在始端和终端不连续的现象 ,
//但任何窗函数都不能解决主瓣处偏离零值点而导致的误差 ,所以其对泄漏的减小也是有限的。
//4  内插技术几乎可以完全消除泄漏的影响 ,但该算法的数据处理量过大 ,实时性难以保证。 
//文献提出了一种减少频谱泄漏的算法 ,其核心是当采样周期与采样点数的乘积等于信号周期整数倍时 ,运用该算法得出的离散序列就是信号的采样序列 ,否则 ,算法将自动调整采样序列。
//仿真证明 ,该算法在信号频率波动不大时 ,对频谱泄漏的改进较明显 ,信号频率波动较大时 ,算法的精度较低。
//上述算法总的特点是对采样序列或频谱进行校正 ,没有从造成频谱泄漏的根本原因上去解决。 这就决定了上述算法或效果不显著 ,或实时性差。 
//造成频谱泄漏的根本原因是 f s≠ N f 0,只有
//5  实时调整 f s ,使 f s = N f 0 , 才能有效解决频谱泄漏。基于上述目的 ,提出了一种自适应调整采样率的算法 ,仿真证明了该算法的有效性 [1]  。

//影响该算法速度的主要是 FFT。 
//近几年来 ,随着特别适合数据处理的 DSP芯片的出现及其在周期信号分析中的应用 , FFT运算速度越来越快 ,利用 V C5402执行 1 024点复数 FFT运算仅需 40几 μs,完全可以满足系统实时性的要求。
//因此 ,本算法在以交流电信号测量为基础的系统中具有较强的实用价值。 目前正将该算法应用于水电站监控系统的设计中
